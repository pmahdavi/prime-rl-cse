# Options for optimizer_save_mode:
# - "full": Use FSDP's full state dict gathering (recommended for most cases)
# - "staged": Use staged gathering for very large models (fallback option)
# - null/omitted: Don't save optimizer state (default for backward compatibility)
optimizer_save_mode = "full"

# Note: When using optimizer_save_mode = "full", the system will:
# 1. Gather all sharded optimizer states to rank 0
# 2. Save as "optimizer.pt" alongside the model weights
# 3. Upload to HuggingFace Hub
#
# For very large models where "full" causes OOM, try "staged" mode.
# This mode attempts to gather optimizer states in chunks to reduce memory usage.
